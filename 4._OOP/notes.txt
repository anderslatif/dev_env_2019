Abstract design away from implementation (behavior is a higher level of abstraction than operation)
Principle of least privilege

The use of abstraction is often now based around relationships based on aggregation / composition

 A singleton pattern ensures that you always get back the same instance of whatever type you are retrieving, whereas the factory pattern generally gives you a different instance of each type.

Objects expose behavior and hide data.
Data Structures expose data and have no significant behavior.
